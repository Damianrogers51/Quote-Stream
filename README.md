# Quote-Stream

"Quote Stream" is a web application that allows users to store a collection of their favorite quotes, which are then automatically iterated through and displayed 
to the user. Users can quickly add, update, and delete quotes from their collection, and pause the stream at any given time. Similarly, each quote is linked 
directly to a Google search, so users can quickly find relevant information related to their favorite quotes.
